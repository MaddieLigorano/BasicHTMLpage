            <div class="Intro"><p>
        My name is Maddie and my major is Computer Specialist programming which I am over <i>50%</i> done towards my degree. 
        At this point I have taken <b>Python, Java, C++, Data Structures, and of course the general ED and pre-reqs.</b> 
        I work as a CNA on second shift for a skilled nursing facility.
    </p></div>
            <div class="Goals"><p style = "color: white">
        I have worked as a therapy recreation assistant and I know how hard it is to entertain people with dementia.
         I would like to develop software to help entertain and to help them <b>store</b> their memories so when they have trouble remembering 
         someone could just click on a link and it would pull up those lost thoughts. 
         Or I would like to work with adaptive equipment to give people a more fulfilling life.
